This project was completed as part of the curriculum for The Odin Project. You can find the directions for the project at the following link:

At this point in the curriculum, this project has been my favorite. As someone who loves to cook, I was really excited to jump into this project and get my creative juices flowing.

Tools used: 
-Modules
-Node.js
-Webpack
-DOM manipulation
-Flexbox
-Grid

It was fun to put my skills to the test by generating a multi-page site generated solely from JavaScript. This project marks the moment that I realized I was actually getting quite comfortable with JavaScript, especially when it comes to DOM maniupulation. Putting my knowledge of modules, Node.js, and webpack to use went smoother than expected. I think this was a great exercise for practicing with those tools since it helped me to learn how to use them in a real-world scenario. Overall, this project was a pleasant mixture of refining
some of my existing skills while also testing the waters with some newly acquired skills.
